My project excutes by simply running the main method.
Once you run the file, it will prompt you to enter the file name.
You need to enter a full file name(i.e. perm15K.txt) or else the program will exit. 
Once you have chosen a valid file it will prompt you to give the amount of thousands of words that the file contains (i.e. 15, 30...). 
Once it gets the valid file size it loads the file into an array to be sorted by one of the methods (This takes some time).  
Once the array is loaded with the file info, you will be prompted to select a sorting method.  
Once the method is selected it prints the amount of time it took to execute the method and write the output file.
THis ends the functionality of the program.
